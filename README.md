### Links

- Live Site URL: [View](https://pizzamenu2.netlify.app/)

## My process

- This React application consists of several components rendered within an App component.
- The App component is the root of the application, containing a Header, Menu, and Footer component.
- The Header component displays the title "Fast React Pizza Co." using inline CSS styles.
- The Menu component renders a list of pizzas dynamically based on data stored in pizzaData, showcasing each pizza's name, ingredients, photo, and price.
- The Footer component dynamically determines if the restaurant is open based on the current time and displays appropriate messaging, including an option to place an order if the restaurant is open.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-Responsive Design
- JavaScript - Scripting language
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was a class project to learn about early components and props.

### Continued development

Maybe used for reference.
